Overview:
This project implements a quiz game using Python, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, data handling with pandas, image display with PIL (Pillow), and sound effects using pygame.
The game loads quiz questions from an Excel file, presents them to the user with multiple-choice options, tracks scores, and provides visual and auditory feedback.

Features:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Tkinter for easy navigation and interaction.
Data Handling: Utilizes pandas to load quiz questions from an Excel file (quiz_data.xlsx).
Image Display: Uses PIL (Pillow) to display images within the GUI.
Sound Effects: Incorporates pygame for auditory feedback on correct and incorrect answers.
Score Tracking: Tracks and displays the user's score throughout the quiz.
Progress Bar: Visualizes the user's progress through the quiz.
Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on each answer with text and color changes.

Contents:
Quiz_Game.py: Main script implementing the quiz game.
Quiz_Data.py: Script to generate and save quiz questions to quiz_data.xlsx.
correct.wav and wrong.wav: Sound files for correct and incorrect answer feedback.
quiz_data.xlsx: Excel file containing the quiz questions and answers.

Requirements:
Python 3.x,
tkinter,
pandas,
Pillow (PIL),
pygame.

Ensure quiz_data.xlsx is present and correctly formatted with quiz questions before running Quiz_Game.py.
Sound effects (correct.wav and wrong.wav) are played using pygame, so ensure the audio files are accessible.
